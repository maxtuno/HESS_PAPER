 Approximation Ratio of a Deterministic Polynomial Black Box Over a MaxSAT Oracle

 We consider in this study an experimental algorithm, of polynomial nature that created from 10 years of experimentation in the laboratory , acts as a deterministic black-box optimizer on several NP problems , including MaxSAT, and the massive number of experiments performed , HESS algorithm always breaks the limits of inapproximability for Max3SAT. To make our experimental study, we have selected a broad set of instances from past SAT competitions. The HESS black-box algorithm , along with all experiment, show on all SATISFIABLE instances, a breaking of the inapproximability ratio for Max3SAT.
